      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Linux stuff</h1>
      <p>For starter, I dont claim to be an expert in linux stuff. You are better off googling whatver you are looking for yourself. Im just a guy trying to share my linux experience in a way that perhaps may help beginners. I was orrinally inspired by <a class="default" href="http://linuxcommand.org">linuxcommand.org</a> to create this site. In fact, I recommend heading there if you are a biginner. I love that site. I must have read it twice. I just wish it was updated with more content. But here is my site so lets talk about linux</p>
	  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">You are using Linux right now!</h1>
	  <p>Believe it or not most websites servers run on Linux, including the one this web page is hosted on! If you are reading on an apple device, you are running Linux. If you are using an android device, you are running Linux. Windows does not run on Linux. Your router at home? Linux. Smart fridge? Linux. Smart watch? Linux. The only place Linux isn't dominant is in the desktop world. Most desktops run windows. And when I say desktop, I mean both home laptops and home PC. But you are probably wondering why I said if you have an apple device its running Linux. The truth is, I lied. Partially. The code written for an apple device and a Linux device more closely similar than an apple device to a windows device. I am just going to leave it at that, because otherwise I would have to get into the technical details, and I don't want to do that. But if you want to learn more you can read this <a class="default" href="https://itsfoss.com/mac-linux-difference/">link</a>.</p>
	  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Why is Linux so widespread and how come I didn't know about it?</h1>
	  <p>The average consumer user uses only a desktop, and most desktops run windows. The fact is, Linux isn't as dominant on the PC. Its mostly run on servers. One reason its mostly used in servers is because it is 100% customizable. What I mean is, if you see something you don't like, or want to add something you do like, you can. For example, if you are using windows and you want to replace the taskbar with a better one, good luck with that. I'm not saying it's not possible, I am saying windows has made it so that you can't, or at least its not very easily removed. Where as in Linux you can in fact remove any part of the system. This is because Linux doesn't force the user to use whatever is given stock. Windows machine you can't windows entirely. There are somethings in windows that just will be that way because Microsoft wants it that way, whereas Linux you can whatever your heart desires. This is what is known as proprietary source and open source respectively. Windows is proprietary source or closed-source, whereas Linux is open source. This means that on windows you can't modify windows code. You don't even have access. it's not openly available to the public, so if you wanted to build windows from scratch, you can't. The code belongs to windows and only windows employees are allowed to see it and modify it. On the other hand, Linux is open source. Meaning that the source is openly available for anyone to see, use, or modify. In fact, here is a link to it <a class="default" href="https://github.com/torvalds/Linux">https://github.com/torvalds/Linux</a>. Mind blown? No? ok. So back to why Linux is widespread on servers is because open source. If you need to make a router, you don't need to install compatibility for a monitor or audio devices, or keyboard and mouse for that matter. So those devices can be completely turned off. And if you are familiar with windows devices manager you will know that you can disable what is known as a driver for the particular hardware you are using, but that's just a cheap shortcut. With Linux you can completely make it impossible to install a driver. the reason why this is good is because of the previous example with the router, you don't need mouse and keyboard support, so that Linux firmware a router is running just isn't built with that support. This is great because it means the firmware is lighter and the code base is lighter too, which makes it easier to debug. The same analogy extends to other devices too. Would you want to have video output support (such as HDMI or VGA) so that you can connect an external monitor your smart watch? Anyway, the point I am trying to get across is this; Linux is widespread because companies modify the Linux code to fit the needs of their hardware, whether it's a router or a smart watch. The other point is that Linux isn't as dominant the PC field because the average user doesn't care about customizing their systems. They just want something that works, which is why windows and apple are so popular.</p>
	  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What is Linux?</h1>
	  <p>I actually went quite a while talking about Linux without actually defining what is Linux. Let's put it this way, Linux is a software. This software runs on a computer. So, Linux is a software than is run in a computer. Simple enough. Is Linux kind of like an app? Is it close to a web browser like chrome? No. Linux is closer to an operating system, which is comparable to Windows OS, and macOs. Linux also has something known as the Linux kernel, which is also comparable to the windows kernel and the apple kernel. What is the difference between an operating system and a kernel? I like this comparison I recently learned. Think of a car. Any car you like. A kernel is kind of like the car engine. Think of all the complicated tasks a car engine has to do. All the turning and twisting and burning. It would be difficult for a human being to manually make the engine move or work, which is why we have an interface in which the user can interact with. Instead of the user using a match to ignite the engine, there is an ignition key. Instead of the user manually having to get out of the car, turn the wheels to turn into a certain direction, and then going back to the car, its much easier to have a stirring wheel. A lot of functions in the car just don't work without the engine running. An operating system is the car. it's the user-friendly interface for the user to interact with the kernel or engine if you will. Linux isn't one operating system. In fact, there are many. Most notably Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Elementary OS, and many more. So when I say Linux I mean any Linux operating system. Other sources may refer to Linux as the Linux kernel. Other sources refer to "any Unix like system", which is basically my definition. If you want a better explanation look for it elsewhere.</p>
	  <p>On the next topic I want to talk about terminals/shell/bash. All of these terms sometime are used interchangeably, I want to explain the difference is and go into more details of <a class="default" href="terminal.html">what is the terminal and how to use it</a>.</p>
